My Process

The process involved starting with a solid HTML structure and then styling it with CSS. I focused on a mobile-first design, ensuring responsiveness and consistent styling across different screen sizes. Additionally, CSS custom properties were used for flexible and maintainable styling.

Key Steps

Set up the HTML structure: Started by creating a basic layout that includes the blog image, title, date, short description, and author section.

Styling with CSS: Applied custom CSS to create a clean, modern look for the card, utilizing CSS variables for colors and fonts.

Responsive Design: Ensured the component adapts seamlessly to both mobile and desktop screens using media queries.

Built With

Semantic HTML5: For structuring the card layout.

CSS Custom Properties: For easier color and font management.

Mobile-first workflow: To prioritize mobile design and then scale up for larger screens.

Continued Development

This challenge was a great exercise in building a reusable and responsive card component. I plan to continue improving my web development skills by working on more projects. For future development, I aim to:

Further enhance the responsiveness, especially for larger screens.
Experiment with animations to make the card interactions more dynamic.
Explore advanced CSS techniques like grid layouts and flexbox-based adjustments for improved alignment.
